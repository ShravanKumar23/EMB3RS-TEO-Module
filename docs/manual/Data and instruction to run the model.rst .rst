Running the TEO for the test case

Data and instruction to run the model 
=================================

The input file for the prototype is ‘Input_file_TEO.xlsx’, which can be accessed at ‘LINK’. To run the TEO, the code files named ‘TEO_Model’, ‘TEO_functions’, TEO_running_file’, and the input file must be downloaded and saved in a specific manner. A main folder called ‘TEO’ must be created and the code will be downloaded into this folder. Within this main folder, two sub folders named ‘Input_data’ and ‘Output_data’ must be created. The input file must be saved into the ‘Input_data’ folder. A representation of how the files must be organised is shown below.  

•	TEO (Main folder) 

   o	Input_data 
   
      	Input_file_TEO.xlsx 
      
   o	Output_data 
   
   o	TEO_Model
   
   o	TEO_functions
   
   o	TEO_running_file

Once the files are downloaded and the folder structure is established, the model can be run using the TEO_running_file. The name if the input directory and the input file must be checked in the TEO_running_file. The TEO module can output results in two formats, excel and csv. The preference for the output format can also be set in the TEO_running_file by specifying a ‘True’ or ‘False’ next to the output formats in the TEO_running_file. Once the TEO analyses in completed, the results file named ‘Input_file_TEO_Results.xlsx’ will be save in ‘Output_data’ sub-folder.
