Results from the TEO
=================================
The techno-economic optimisation module should provide the following results:

The technology mix (in terms of existing and newly installed yearly capacities in terms of energy flows throughout the supply-demand chain)

The installed capacities at the different sources is shown in Figure below. The model only uses 2 source outflows from the Metal casting industry. The excess heat from the      supermarket is not used use due to the low temperatures and thus needs expensive investments.

              Source capacities
    
The installed capacities at the different sinks is shown in the Figure below. The sinks capacities are based on the sink demand. As the demand grow over the years, the capacity is also increased.

Share of each technology in meeting the demand in any time step of the analysis (where the time resolution is defined by the user within certain limits) and throughout the analysis period 


The installed capacities of storages is shown in the Figure below. The model only installs storages at the sink site since it is easier to control installed capacities in the DHN if the storage is located after the DHN. The storage capacities are also based on the sink demand. As the demand grow over the years, the storage capacity is also increased.

The Intra annual heat generation from sources is shown in the Figure below. The heat generation from the sources does not follow the demand profile due to the storages in the system. We see that the heat generation is constant in most time steps and there are drastic variations in a few TimeSlices.  This is because of the charging and discharging from the storage which is seen next.

The Intra annual storage charge or discharge for Residential buildings is shown in Figure below. The storage is continuously cycled according to the sink demand profiles.

 Annual costs (investment, fuel, operation & maintenance) associated with the technologies. The investment costs for the sinks is shown in the Figure below.

 The operation and maintenance costs of the sources and the sinks is shown in the Figure below.
