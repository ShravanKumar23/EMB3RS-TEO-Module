EMB3RS project
=================================

EMB3Rs (â€œUser-driven Energy-Matching & Business Prospection Tool for Industrial Excess Heat/Cold Reduction, Recovery and Redistribution) is a European project funded under the H2020 Programme (Grant Agreement No.847121) to develop an open-sourced tool to match potential sources of excess thermal energy with compatible users of heat and cold. More information about the EMB3RS project can be found on the `EMB3RS website <https://www.emb3rs.eu/>`_ .

Users, like industries and other sources that produce excess heat, will provide the essential parameters, such as their location and the available excess thermal energy. The EMB3Rs platform will then autonomously and intuitively assess the feasibility of new business scenarios and identify the technical solutions to match these sources with compatible sinks. End users such as building managers, energy communities or individual consumers will be able to determine the costs and benefits of industrial excess heat and cold utilisation routes and define the requirements for implementing the most promising solutions. The EMB3Rs platform will integrate several analysis modules that will allow a full exploration of the feasible technical routes to the recovery and use of the available excess thermal energy. Several other modules are a part of the EMB3RS platform. Each module will be used to conduct a special purpose task or analysing excess heat and cold recovery. The models and their primary functionalities are specified below

Core functionalities module: This module characterises the sources and the sinks of excess heat and determines the supply and demand profiles and the relevant technologies that can be used based on the temperature of the available excess heat.

GIS module: This module optimizes the piping layout and the pipe capacities of district heating and cooling network connecting all the sinks and the sources in the system.

TEO Module: The TEO module determine the most cost optimal matching between the sinks and the sources

Market Module: The market module creates a market based simulation for each actors i.e. source of sink in the system. The module determines the optimal bids for each actor in a day ahead market for both the short and the long term.

Business Module: The Business module determines the financial feasibility of the different investments and calculates the payback time for the project.
