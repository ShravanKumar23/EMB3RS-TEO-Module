Welcome to EMB3RS TEO Module's documentation!
=============================================
EMB3RS, https://www.emb3rs.eu/

EMB3Rs (â€œUser-driven Energy-Matching & Business Prospection Tool for Industrial Excess Heat/Cold Reduction, Recovery and Redistribution) is a European project funded under the H2020 Programme (Grant Agreement No.847121) to develop an open-sourced tool to match potential sources of excess thermal energy with compatible users of heat and cold. Users, like industries and other sources that produce excess heat, will provide the essential parameters, such as their location and the available excess thermal energy. The EMB3Rs platform will then autonomously and intuitively assess the feasibility of new business scenarios and identify the technical solutions to match these sources with compatible sinks. End users such as building managers, energy communities or individual consumers will be able to determine the costs and benefits of industrial excess heat and cold utilisation routes and define the requirements for implementing the most promising solutions. The EMB3Rs platform will integrate several analysis modules that will allow a full exploration of the feasible technical routes to the recovery and use of the available excess thermal energy.
