Main Features of TEO Module 
=================================
•	The TEO module will be able to optimize the matching between the different sources and the sinks, while taking into account various technical and economic constraints, such as demand profiles, technology cost, efficiencies and losses while also considering thermal energy storage.

•	Optimal mix of investments in technologies and optimal capacities in storage and district heating network can be determined for a model with 48 intra annual time slices. The operation of the technologies and the intra annual heat supply is also optimized in the current version of the module. 

•	The module can also analyze the competition between centralized and de-centralized. The current input data includes competition between waste heat sources and decentralized solar thermal based heating solutions
